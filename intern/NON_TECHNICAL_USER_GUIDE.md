## 🎯 What is a Mindmap?

A **mindmap** is a visual way to organize ideas. Think of it like a tree:
- The **root** (top) is your main topic
- **Branches** (below) are related ideas
- **Leaves** (further down) are details

**Example**: Planning a party
- Root: "My Birthday Party"
- Branch: "Food" → Leaves: "Cake", "Pizza", "Drinks"
- Branch: "Guests" → Leaves: "Family", "Friends"
- Branch: "Location" → Leaves: "Home", "Park"
